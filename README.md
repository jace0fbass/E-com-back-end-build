# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description
In this challenge I have created Models for categories, products, product tags, and tags. I have also created api routes to find all categories, products, and tags, find one of each by their id, create categories, products, and tags and update or delete them by their id. I have used 
Express, Sequelize, MySQL, Dotenv, and Nodemon to run the application and Insomnia to test the API routes.
